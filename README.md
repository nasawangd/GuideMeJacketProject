# GuideMe Project
(Formerly known as the GuideMeJacket Project)
University of Washington Capstone Project

The GuideMe system is a Raspberry Pi that utilizes ultrasonic sensors that work in tandem with vibration motors that,
when mounted on a belt, signal the user that they are approaching an obstacle. The vibration motors start giving feedback 
at specific intervals depending on the object's distance.
